Other exceptions may be made by the Club President or (only if the President is unavailable) by two Board Members. If approved at all, exceptions may be made contingent (as is directed by the President, or the approving Board Members) on:&nbsp; &nbsp;(a)<u> Minimizing </u>inconvenience to other members when possible (choice of dates, choice of times, possibly accommodating other members who do show up during the function), and (b) Notice provided to all members by having the reservation posted on the online calendar by the reservation coordinator at least one week in advance.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Reservations should be made through the Palisades Beach Club website (www.palisadesbeachclub.com) under “Reservations” section. If a member does not have access to the Internet, reservations should be made by calling and confirmed by Suzy Miller. If leaving a message, please list the type of reservation (Open/Closed), the date, time and how many guests will be attending. All reservations must be made no later than one week prior to the event. This will allow time for members to make plans for the upcoming week. Insofar as possible, a duplicate calendar will be posted at the Club, but it is not official and may vary from that of the website. Please check the website before visiting the club, especially on Thursdays and Fridays during the summer season. To change or cancel a reservation, please submit the change request online under “Reservations”.&nbsp; Reservation fees will be billed with dues for the next fiscal year in June.</li>
    <li>Special daytime parties and meetings (more than four guests) may be allowed with permission in advance from the Club President or any two Directors if the President is not available. Such reservations will be considered <strong>"Open"</strong> and requests should be made through the “Reservation” website after approval has been granted. The number of guests and members present is limited to 12, unless a larger number is approved by the President or any two Board Members. No reservations are allowed on any Saturday during the “On Season” or on any Sunday.</li>
